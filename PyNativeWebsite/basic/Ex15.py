# Exercise 15: Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.

# Note here exp is a non-negative integer, and the base is an integer.
# case 1:
# base = 2
# exponent = 5
#
# 2 raises to the power of 5: 32 i.e. (2 *2 * 2 *2 *2 = 32)

x = 2
y = 5
z = x ** y
print(z)
